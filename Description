new idea
I invite all friends who would like to collaborate on a new project.
This is the idea about technology in medicine.I will cover the generalities of this idea.
My idea for doctors and researchers to have access to all people remotely.
Imagine a person living in a place far away from doctors or researchers, and the only way doctors and researchers can reach this person is through the internet.
Of course, this person cannot transfer their body information to a doctor or researcher at specific times to ensure their health.
So we want to make this data transfer easier here using technology and blockchain.
For this purpose, we need to continuously send information about the individual's body to doctors and researchers, which will be done via blockchain.
We place a chip in the toilet of the person's home to analyze the person's stool and piss and send the information separately to the doctor. 
In the next step, the person's body temperature and blood test are measured and analyzed by other chipsets and sent to researchers and doctors.
This data transfer from the individual to the doctor is done daily or at specific time periods.
When the data is sent to doctors, they have an archive of each person's body information.
Doctors can identify any disorder or problems using artificial intelligence that has access to this data.
Artificial intelligence can use this information to alert doctors and researchers at the best time so that the best response can be made.
All of this data transfer is done via blockchain to ensure speed, security, and cost-effectiveness.

These were the general outlines of my idea that I shared with you so that we could form a useful and valuable group to achieve this goal.
If you think you can be a part of this team, please join our group.
